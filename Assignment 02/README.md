### Main Problems:
The main challenges encountered while working through these questions included handling complex logic and optimizing program design for a variety of tasks. Some tasks required careful management of array manipulations and conditional checks, like finding the second smallest element and detecting scrambled (anagram) transactions. Challenges in string and character operations were also present, such as character frequency analysis in slogans and compressing repeated characters efficiently in strings. Multi-dimensional arrays posed additional difficulties, as seen in tasks involving 2D arrays for adventure game grids or searching for patterns in grids based on input strings. Furthermore, the pattern-based question required thoughtful loop structures and intricate control over spacing, particularly for larger values of N. Managing edge cases and ensuring robustness in user inputs also proved challenging across these tasks, adding to the overall complexity of implementing these solutions.
